# Enhanced Accuracy and Customization in Hand Gesture Cursor Control Using Python and OpenCV

## 📌 Project Description
This project implements a hand gesture–based cursor control system that allows users to control mouse movement, clicks, and scrolling using hand gestures captured through a webcam. Built using Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe, the system focuses on enhanced accuracy, smooth cursor control, and customizable gesture settings, offering a touchless alternative to traditional input devices.
